<h2>Why do I like it?</h2>
I mainly like Bloons TD 6 because of its replayability, as every time you play a match it is different as you might be on a different map, most definitely different towers will be used and also if you just started new towers to experiment with. There is a insanely low chance of doing the exact same things at the same times each time you play on a specific map. Although once you get into the 100s of waves/rounds they start to slow down but you really only reach that point if you enter freeplay, while in freeplay you get less XP and tower XP but if you beat wave 100 you get a free insta, instas are one time use free towers with an amount of upgrades but they use game terminology, BTD6 game terminology is mostly saying "I am trying to get a 0-5-2 dart monkey," in the example i just showed what a 0-5-2 dart monkey is, is just the upgrade paths used, where the first number is the top path, middle number is middle path, and third number is bottom path, so a 0-5-2 dart monkey is no upgrades in thee top path, max upgraded middle path, and 2 upgrades in bottom path.<br>
