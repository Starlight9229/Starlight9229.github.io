<h2>What is BTD6 (Bloons td 6)?</h2>
Bloons TD 6 is a fun tower defence game, while most other popular tower defence
games are normally about using guns, or other modern weapons to fend off zombies
BTD6 is about monkeys defending from balloons using various weird and wacky
weapons like darts, grapes, tacks, and some other strange weapons but there are
cases of the monkeys using guns to pop the balloons.<br />

While some people may not enjoy Bloons TD 6 I do, if you want more info on why I
like this game click on the 'why do i like it?' button above this menu. If you
do play it and enjoy it the rounds go by fast, well time does, I bought it for
one of my friends and for us to play together he needed to be lvl 20, it felt
like he was levelling up really fast but it still took at least 45 minutes but
only felt like 15. Well that's enough rambling time for a new paragraph<br />

So Bloons TD 6 is a tower defence game, but you don't start with all towers unlocked, or even all the upgrades unlocked. As you use a tower it'll gain xp, you can then use the towers' xp to unlock new upgrades for it such as the dart monkeys enhanced eyesight upgrade, I won't say what it does because if you want to play this game yourself without many spoilers I don't want to spoil anything. But to unlock new towers is another story, most towers you unlock by levelling up, but three towers you get from other means, such as completing special quests called "Tales," while only two of the three towers you get from these tales, one of them you don't need to go out of the way to get, unless you want to get it faster. To get that one tower you need to pop an amount of balloons, I am not going to say how much here, but you can just really look at the wiki, I'll link the BTD6 wiki

I don't really know what else to say without spoiling too much of the game so that's going to be all I'll put in this area of my likes of BTD6 so just go to the <span onclick="showId('whyI')" class="gold-gradient-link">Why do I like it?</span> section of this page. <br>
